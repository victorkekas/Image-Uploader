The user will _select_ from his gallery a number of images where a _Pedestrian is hindered - annoyed by Vehicels_ on the pavement.

This hindrance might be a car parked in front of a ramp for dissabled people, a motorbike that has blocked the *line* that blind people use to walk on the road, cars parked on crosswalks, and all other kinds of things.
